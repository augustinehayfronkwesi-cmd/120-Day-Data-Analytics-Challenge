Day 10 of building in public.

Today I learned about array functions and text functions — and it felt like unlocking hidden shortcuts in data.

Array functions showed me how to handle multiple values at once instead of repeating the same formula over and over. It’s like thinking in batches instead of one-by-one. More efficient. More powerful.

Text functions reminded me that data isn’t always numbers. Sometimes the real cleaning work is in trimming spaces, extracting names, splitting strings, or standardizing messy entries. Small text issues can break big analysis.

I’m starting to realize something:
Data analysis isn’t just about charts and dashboards.
It’s about cleaning, structuring, and thinking clearly before anything becomes “insight.”
