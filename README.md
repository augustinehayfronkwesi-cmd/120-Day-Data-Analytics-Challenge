Day 2 of Data Analytics LockedIn
Today i learned about measures of central
tendency(mean,median,mode) and also measures of spread(range,standard deviation,IQR)
And how these two measures help in real life applications
and also making big decisions when it comes to analysis
Measures of spread actually tells the full story of data after finding average
Measures of central tendency also helps to identify problems and also spot trends.
Data is teaching me  patience and trying to make me
see beyond the obvious
