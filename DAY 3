Day 3 of my 120-day challenge

Today I moved from just knowing probability to understanding how it behaves in the real world.

Uniform distribution showed me fairness — a situation where every outcome has an equal chance.
Poisson distribution showed me how randomness can be measured over time.

I also learned the clear difference between probability and uniform distribution:
	•	Probability = the chance that something will happen.
	•	Uniform distribution = a situation where all possible outcomes have equal chances.

Probability is the concept.
Uniform distribution is one specific way probability can be arranged.
