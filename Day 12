Day 11 of 120 

Today I learned about Tables, Formatting, and Collaboration in Excel — and it felt like turning raw data into something structured, clear, and ready to share.

• Tables help organize large datasets and make analysis easier.
• Formatting makes your data readable, clean, and easy to understand.
• Collaboration allows teams to work on the same file in real time, improving speed and accuracy.

Every day I’m realizing that data analysis isn’t just about formulas and dashboards. It’s about clarity, structure, and teamwork.

Less manual work. More smart work.
