Day 4 of 120 Day Data Analysis Locked In
Today I dived into hypothesis in data analysis. 🧠

A hypothesis is basically a statement we can test with data. It’s our starting point for understanding patterns, trends, or problems.

Key points I learned:
	•	Null hypothesis (H₀): The default assumption (no effect or no difference).
	•	Alternative hypothesis (H₁): What you want to test or prove.
	•	Use data and statistics to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
	•	It turns intuition into testable insights—helping decisions backed by evidence.

Hypotheses = the bridge between questions and answers in data.
