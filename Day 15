Today was focused on a guided project where we built a Sales Dashboard from scratch. At the beginning, everything felt blurry. I struggled to see how the data, visuals, and filters connected. But step by step, the clarity came. By the end of the session, it felt like coming through a storm and finally seeing the bigger picture.

🔍 What we worked on
	•	Cleaned and structured raw sales data to make it analysis-ready.
	•	Built interactive visuals that respond to filters instead of static reports.
	•	Learned how to organize charts and KPIs in a logical flow for better storytelling.
	•	Applied dashboard design principles so users can easily understand insights.
	•	Focused on business thinking: moving beyond formulas to asking the right questions.

🧠 Problems we solved
	•	How to transform unstructured data into a clear business view.
	•	How to design dashboards that help decision-making, not just look good.
	•	How to highlight key metrics like revenue, sales trends, and performance indicators.
	•	How to guide users’ attention using layout and visual hierarchy.
