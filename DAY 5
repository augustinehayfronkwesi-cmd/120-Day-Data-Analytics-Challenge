Day 5 of #BuildInPublic

Today I explored Time Series Analysis. 📈

It’s all about understanding data over time—trends, seasonality, and patterns that repeat. I realized it’s like listening to a story: every point is a moment, and together they reveal the bigger picture.

Time series analysis isn’t just numbers moving—it’s predicting the future by learning from the past, spotting patterns, and making smarter decisions.

I’m starting to see how powerful it is to let data tell its timeline.
