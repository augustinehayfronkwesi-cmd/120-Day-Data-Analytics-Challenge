Today I learned that charts aren’t decorations they’re decisions.

A column chart compares categories.
A line chart reveals trends.
A pie shows proportions.
A scatter plot uncovers relationships.

But the real lesson?

Choosing the wrong chart can hide insight.
Choosing the right one can make patterns obvious.

Data doesn’t speak loudly.
Visualization gives it a voice.

I’m starting to understand that being a good analyst isn’t about knowing all charts — it’s about knowing when to use which one.

From numbers → to patterns → to clarity.
