Today I learnt more about Excel formulas and functions. I practised using SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX and MIN, and also text functions like CONCAT, LEFT and RIGHT. I also started learning how VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP work for searching and connecting data.

This is helping me understand how to organise data better and do calculations faster instead of doing everything manually.

One thing I realised is that small formula mistakes can change everything, so I need to pay attention to details and practise more. At first some of the functions looked confusing, but after trying them myself, they started to make sense.
